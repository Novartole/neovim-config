Here is my configuration of Neovim which I use for Rust and Lua development.

It is powered by [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager and uses [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) as the primary theme.

Note that some plugins require additional tools being installed. An easy way to find the tools is 
- put this repo into the config folder (that is _~/.config/nvim/_ by default)
- open nvim
- check the result of calling:
```vi
:checkhealth
```
